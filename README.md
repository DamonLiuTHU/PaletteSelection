Automatic Color Palette Selection (Python)
====

Simple python demos of Automatic Color Palette Selection [Garcia-Dorado et al. 2015].

They proposed **palette-based photo recoloring** method for image editing.

I will implement automatic color palette selection part for a single image.

## Result
*Status*: Under construction.

## Installation

*Note*: This program was only tested on **Windows** with **Python2.7**.
**Linux** and **Mac OS** are not officially supported,
but the following instructions might be helpful for installing on those environments.

### Dependencies
Please install the following required python modules.

* **NumPy**
* **SciPy**
* **matplotlib**
* **OpenCV**

As these modules are heavily dependent on NumPy modules, please install appropriate packages for your development environment (Python versions, 32-bit or 64-bit).
For 64-bit Windows, you can download the binaries from [**Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages**](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).

This program also uses **docopt** for CLI.
**docopt** will be installed automatically through the following **pip** command for main modules.
